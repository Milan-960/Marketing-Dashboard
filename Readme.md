## Challenges

- Did some Reaserch on figuring out [Ej2](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/demos/#/bootstrap5/chart/overview) to build charts from the given API

- Figuring out how to best display the data from given API the amount of fields and data. I decided to split it between qualitative and quantitative data, with one being manipulated by the dates, and other by the various qualitative types

## What Can Be Improve

- Would configure the Redux for a state Managment!

- Would add tests for components and functions

- Would setup the project with TypeScript

- Sort out components better so they are broken down without need of functions. Break it down for better reusability and readability

- Adding a couple more charts to showcase the fields further, like a radial graph

- Configure webpack Modules to speed up and serve as a Static Files!

- Add Lazy loading React components for optimizing DashBoard

## PS: This DashBoard is AKA fully responsive and can be accessible from any browser and mobile devices
